# ItIsMeProjekt

This is a small and simple application that I developed using Angular. This application serves as a CV in the form of a web page. 
During the development I used HTML, SCSS and TypeScript. 

you can clone or download the "src" folders

The information is saved in variables in the file " src -> App-> main -> main.component.ts". so you just have to type your own data there.
